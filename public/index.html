	<aside class="notes">
Now, I'm Jeff Goff with Clearbuilt technologies [and we might be hiring].

This module is available on CPAN as I speak, and I think I see a few people getting ahead of me and reading the find manual right now.

It doesn't use special database features, and in fact I made it a point to run the tests in SQLite to make sure we don't use fancy triggers or non-compatible SQL. We tested extensively on Postgres though, so it works well with most database products out there.

		<li class="fragment">Cache invalidation</li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
		So, here's the elevator pitch version of the talk. If you do data warehousing, need to control access to columns or need to simplify your DB logic, sit back and see if this solution is right for you.

	<h2>The Business (logic)</h2>
	<ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Projects are composed of Items</li>
			<li>Items have IDs, names and parent project IDs</li>
			<li>Also, they have unit price, number of units and total price</li>
			<li>Projects also have total prices</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Reading down this list, if you've been trained in DB admin,
		your eyes should get wider and wider, and there are probably
		a few of you bursting at the seams to tell me what I'm doing
		wrong.</p>
		<p>And you're right, but this is a real-world application, and
		the real world can be messy and even tearful at times.</p>
	</aside>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>UI constraints</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>IDs are read-only columns</li>
		<li>A Project's total price == total of its Items</li>
		<li>An Item's total price == quantity * unit_price</li>
		<li>Change any of the columns, the rest update</li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>These are pretty normal constraints to live in. You don't
		want to modify the relationship between parts and their
		component projects, the only things that should change
		are the prices as the market fluctuates, and maybe the
		names.</p>
		<p>And of course there are a bunch of ways to do this.
		The proper way is with calculated columns, which are a
		pretty new feature in SQL, and only a few databases so
		far support them. Making the columns read-only is easy
		as well, but interpreting the errors to the user may not
		be that easy. Triggers will work as well, but you need at
		least one per column, and they'll change in an interlocking
		fashion.</p>

		<p>Now things get a little more complex. We've got two
		steps to implement the business logic, so we'll take it
		a step at a time. First we're going to get rid of the
		stale data.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Whenever the quantity of an item (yes, I know...)
		changes, its total price becomes out-of-whack. And as a
		bonus, so does the total price of the entire *project*.
		So the first part here simply NULLs out those related
		columns. It follows the DBIC chain from the project
		ID out to the project's total price too.</p>

	<aside class="notes">
		<P>If it helps, you can think of these columns now as quantum
		entangled. Affecting one column changes the others.
		This all happens well below the layer that you'll most
		commonly use as a DBIx::Class user.</p>

	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Now that we can clear out invalid data, let's automate
		the process of how we update columns. It's as simple as
		adding a calculation to that column, right at the point
		of creation.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Also point out that it's triggered by NULLing a column.
		This can also be done in a lazy fashion, so the next time

"After this thrilling description I'm sure you're dying how see it in action.

[Damn, may have to make up a quick DB app...]

Track 1:

(load app, go to edit screen)

"Here we're navigating a typical Dancer2 app, editing a DB record. You can see a generic ID key and a few other columns.

"Let's see the first feature in action. (Change ID, click enter) Here we've declared the ID read-only, this is useful for your new users, and supports some other features of the app.

(Switch to code display) ((Maybe fo it all on Lynx?))
"Let's see where we threw that exception. You could do that in the edit code... Here we are. No exceptions here. We just take the fields and dump them in, nothing special 
"Could be over in the schema, because you can override column accessors. Hrm, nope. Those of you with quick eyes may have noticed me quickly jumping to the bottom of the file, like I was hiding something.

"Guess what, you're right. Let's scroll back up and look at where we defined the iD column.

"Nothing unusual... Wait, is_nullable is fine but unusual, what's this is_readonly though?

"That's all that you need to do to add LazyCache to your app. Almost." (Scroll up) It's a DBIx helper, so you have to add our component.

"How many of you out there write DBIx schema's by hand? With Schema:: Loader? With Candy? Okay, how many of you have heard of the DBIx::Class::Candy module?

"I hadn't until I delved into the world of the DBIx helpers. The good work news is that we support all of you. You can add LazyCache attributes directly to your class definition, use __PACKAGE__ methods - in this case the fairly mnemonic 'make_readonly', or finally we've declared Candy synonyms of just that, make_readonly. And what's even better is those mutators let you add columns in masse.

"So, you can stop people from editing random columns. Not really a big deal when you think about it, but it's a start.

"What you need to write gets more complex from here, but not by much. Let's

Database contains this:
-->

<!--

Just show the Project table first.

"Now, we can move on to something more interesting. This is a warehouse style table containing a record of Projects.

"You can probably guess that the retail price is based on the wholesale price and the profit margin. It could go the other way 'round too, but we'll pretend that case doesn't exist. Not that we can't handle it, but it'd complicate things.

"It's a bit contrived to be sure, but worse things lurk in the dark corners of any legacy DB, I can assure you.

"Now, we could create this rule as a trigger on the database, to be sure, firing on create. That's one case. But already we see a little complication. Look at the profit margin. It's nullable, so it's just possible that someone might create an entry with that empty, to be filled in at a later date.

"So, we'll need a trigger for update as well, and because we don't want to repeat the calculation there's gotta be a stored procedure associated with it as well.

"You've now got two triggers, maybe more, and a stored procedure. So whoever wants to update the code after you needs to know Perl to handle the schema and SQL to update the procedures.

"And you've lost portability because stored procedures aren't portable across platforms, and some databases don't support triggers that'll run like you think they should.

"In Perl the situation's not much better. When you go to create a Project record you've got to try to populate that column.

"And think about this - there are 3 columns that you've got to deal with. As long as any 2 of them you can figure out the 3rd, do there are a bunch of cases to work through.

"Why go to allow this trouble when you can just do this?
-->

<!--
"This stops anyone from editing the column in DBI, and defines the business logic at the same point in the code. This code will run if that column is NULL and populate thatqP
